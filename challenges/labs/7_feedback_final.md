*    Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?
       * Useful: 
            * I have learned a lot about setting up a productive cluster. 
              Most topics such as security or monitoring are discussed with customers frequently.
              It will definitily an advandtage in those discussions to be more experienced and knowing the topics from the practical side.
       * Difficult: 
            * In the past, the main focus was on development technologies, such as Hive, Impala or Spark. 
              From that a gap resulted between knowledge about implementation and the administration of the environment.
            * The variety about OS and versions made it difficult. 
              For the future, I suggest to provide a recommended setting (e.g. CentOS 7.2, MySQL 5.6) to have a more homogeneous class discussion.
                 
*    Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?
       * Least familiar: Kerberos and Sentry
       * Most familiar: Mysql database rights and Hive queries
    
*    Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?
       * Most helpful: Kerberos, Sentry, and Hue
       * Least helpful: setup of the cluster using CM (Monday lab) -> could be done upfront as a concrete preparation task
       
*    How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?
       * I am going to start directly with setting up a secure and "production-like" installation our demo-cluster.
         That should once again ensure the knowledge and prepare me to do the same on customers' site.
